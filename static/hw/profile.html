<h1>The Profile</h1>

<p>This rubric is to be used as a <em>guideline</em> to help your group develop
a document and presentation about a company, organization, product, project, or
community. Not all sections will be applicable to your particular subject, but
you <strong>must</strong> fill in <em>why</em> that particular query does not
apply in your case.</p>

<p>You don't have to get <em>too</em> fancy with it, but your profile
<strong>MUST</strong> include some type of appendix, footnotes, bibliography,
or in-line citations for all sources where your information was gathered.
(Attribution <em>is</em> the coin of the realm in FOSS, and the core of
Academic Honesty.)</p>

<p>Your group will have <strong>10 Minutes</strong> to present your findings,
and answer questions. Your presentation <strong>must</strong> be internet
accessible, creative commons licensed (see: <a target="_blank"
href="/syllabus#licensing">syllabus</a>), and will preferably available after
the completion of this course. Building a crowd-sourced body of research
profiles on FOSS organizations and projects is one small way we all can
contribute back to the Hackademic Community, and help future iterations of the
bizlegfoss course here at RIT (and maybe even elsewhere someday!)</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>There are <em>so</em> many subjects you could choose to profile, so why did
you choose this one? What drew you into wanting to know more about the
organization? How did you/your group decide on and agree?</p>

<h2>Organizational Details</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Is the subject of your profile a corporate entity?</li>
    <li>What type?</li>
    <li>When was it founded?</li>
    <li>By whom?</li>
    <li>Original founder(s) still active?</li>
    <li>Publicly Traded? Since when? Initial Stock Price? Current stock price?</li>
    <li>Has the company made any acquisitions? If yes, which companies, and what were their core products?</li>
    <li>Has the company made any investments in other companies? If yes, which ones.</li>
    <li>Number of Employees?</li>

</ol>

<h2>Communications</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Does your subject participate in social media? If yes, please list a
    URL for each account, and reach within that community. (i.e. <a
    target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/redhatnews">Twitter:
    @RedHatNews</a> - 61.9K Followers.</li>
    <li>What communication channels does your subject use to reach their
    public? Briefly describe and include a URL for each.</li>
    <li>Does your subject organize or participate in any conferences? If so, list them here, and provide links to any relevant sessions, keynotes, or content.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Community Architecture</h2>
<p>Your subject likely runs or contributes to one or more Open Source products
or projects. Choose one (or more) of these and answer the following questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <p>If applicable, list and provide links to:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
        <li>The project's IRC Channel</li>
        <li>Source Code repository</li>
        <li>Mail list archive</li>
        <li>Documentation</li> 
        <li>Other communication channels</li>
        <li>Project Website and/or Blog</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>

    <li>Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.</li>

    <li>
    Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest
    commit?
    </li>

    <li>
    Who approves patches? How many people?
    </li>

    <li>
    Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?
    </li>

    <li>
    Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of
    contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)
    </li>

    <li>
    Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent
    Dictator for Life)
    </li>

    <li>
    Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the
    proportion of each?
    </li>

    <li>
    What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen
    during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?
    </li>

    <li>
    How is the project's participation trending and why?
    </li>

    <li>
    In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the
    project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a
    Velociraptor?) Why or why not?
    </li>

    <li>
    In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active
    20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?
    </li>

    <li>
    Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new
    contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically
    on newbies, etc...)
    </li>

    <li>
    Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it
    include code examples?
    </li>

    <li>
    If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or
    hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?
    </li>

    <li>
    Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making
    structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building,
    ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or
    pair of individuals?
    </li>

    <li>
    Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?
    </li>
</ol>
